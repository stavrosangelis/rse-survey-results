19:T566,In Ireland, it would be beneficial to universities to allow Digital Humanities departments more flexibility in how they hire RSE developers. Wages are low for the kind of experience and talent they ideally want to hire. Red tape in the hiring process makes getting and keeping a RSE role risky. Benefits are practically non existent compared to industry standards (healthcare etc).

Also, I, and possibly other self employed devs and agencies would, be able to offer services to the departments on a flexible, as hoc basis if contracting policies were not blocking this from being possible. I think many projects would only need a developer or agency for a free weeks or months during key parts of the research project, rather than fixed term contracts. However this is not possible in Ireland due to university contracting policies.

Finally, dev ops need to be embarrassed by universities. Having a rigid IT structure makes it difficult or impossible to setup CI/CD workflows to make software infrastructure easier to deploy and maintain long term. Again, this is where policy for 99% of university departments is massively holding back Digital Research and Digital Humanities projects. Perhaps this would work best if there was a dedicated RSE department that works with Digital Humanities (and other departments) who specializes in delivering software projects for universities?a:["$","$L12",null,{"maxWidth":"lg","children":[["$","$L13",null,{"container":true,"spacing":2,"children":[["$","$L13",null,{"size":{"xs":12},"children":["$","$L14",null,{"sx":{"padding":"15px"},"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Research Software Engineering in the Arts and Humanities"}],["$","h2",null,{"children":"Community Interest Group Survey"}],["$","h3",null,{"children":["Number of participants: ",["$","small",null,{"children":24}]]}]]}]}],[["$","$L13","0",{"size":{"xs":12,"sm":6},"children":["$","$L14",null,{"sx":{"padding":"15px"},"children":["$","$L15",null,{"data":["16/10/2024 16:56-16/10/2024 17:11","17/10/2024 07:39-17/10/2024 07:57","17/10/2024 11:55-17/10/2024 12:09","18/10/2024 11:31-18/10/2024 11:54","19/10/2024 06:40-19/10/2024 06:52","21/10/2024 12:39-21/10/2024 12:54","21/10/2024 15:59-21/10/2024 16:16","21/10/2024 17:54-21/10/2024 18:03","22/10/2024 11:34-22/10/2024 15:48","23/10/2024 07:58-23/10/2024 08:30","23/10/2024 10:48-23/10/2024 11:01","23/10/2024 10:52-23/10/2024 11:27","23/10/2024 11:06-24/10/2024 12:17","23/10/2024 15:13-25/10/2024 08:47","25/10/2024 08:07-25/10/2024 09:00","25/10/2024 13:13-25/10/2024 13:46","29/10/2024 10:27-29/10/2024 10:33","30/10/2024 18:58-30/10/2024 19:25","01/11/2024 11:41-01/11/2024 11:49","01/11/2024 13:39-01/11/2024 13:46","07/11/2024 11:48-07/11/2024 11:58","13/11/2024 09:10-13/11/2024 09:57","13/11/2024 10:11-13/11/2024 10:24","14/11/2024 10:00-14/11/2024 11:47"],"index":1}]}]}],["$","$L13","1",{"size":{"xs":12,"sm":6},"children":["$","$L14",null,{"sx":{"padding":"15px"},"children":["",["$","$L16",null,{"data":[{"id":0,"value":19,"label":"uk"},{"id":1,"value":5,"label":"ireland"}],"title":"2.
